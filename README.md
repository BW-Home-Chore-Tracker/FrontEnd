**PITCH**

Every parent knows the struggle of getting their kids to consistently and meaningfully contribute to the household chores. If you are tired of the exorbitant allowance demands, half-done chores, and dubious claims that "I can't put that away because I don't know where it goes!" or "Johnny's parents are better than you because they don't make him do chores...", then ChoreChallenge is the tool you have been waiting for. 

With ChoreChallenge, it's easy to get your kids excited about chores with our "gamified" approach to household chore tracking and management. Easily create a list of chores (or use one of our templates) and then randomly assign them to your children. 

Foster healthy competition and habits with ChoreScore and CleanStreaks: our proprietary chore rating and tracking tools that have been (un)scientifically proven to be 100% more effective than side-eye and time-outs. 

Create accountability with ChoreCheck - never again find that 6 month old lost banana rotting behind your precious little angel's nightstand. By requiring a photo of the completed chore to be uploaded, *you* decide if that chore is actually completed or not.

With ChoreTracker in their corner, parents can effortlessly turn household chores from "bore" into "score!"

**MVP**

1. User can signup/register/create an account as a "Parent" (web)

2. User can login with their chosen username and password (web & mobile)

3. Authenticated "Parent" can add kids to their "Family" and create/register "Child" accounts for each child. (web)

4. Authenticated "Parent" can create a list of custom chores, or select chores from a template/list of common household chores. (web)

5. Authenticated "Parent" can randomly assign chores to each "Child" added to the "Family" (web)

6. Implement a scoring system: ChoreScore - each chore has the same "baseline" points value, but completing chores quickly allows "Child" to earn "Bonus Points", and CleanStreaks - a metric to track how consistently each "Child" completes their assigned chores. (web & mobile)

7. "Child" can log into mobile companion app - using assigned username and password. (mobile)

8. Authenticated "Child" can see all their assigned chores and due-dates, ChoreScore, CleanStreaks, and any comments or messages from the "Parent". (mobile)

9. Authenticated "Child" can check off completed tasks, and submit a photo of the completed chore (and optional comment) for manual approval, if required by "Parent". (mobile)

**Stretch**

1. Implement an interactive randomizer in the mobile app to be used by an Authenticated "Child" that takes a list of unassigned chores, and requires the "Child" to perform some action to get assigned chores. Think "Wheel of Fortune"... (mobile)

2. As the "Due Date" approaches the color of the chore changes to indicate urgency (think red, yellow and green). (web & mobile)

3. Use the "Due date" of a chore to set up a local reminder notification in the mobile app. (mobile)

4. Implement Push Notifications to send "Parent" a notification when a chore has been completed/needs approval. (mobile)

5. Implement appropriate Accessibility to accommodate children with special needs. (mobile)

**Stretch Goal, Level 9000:**1. Use ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android) to implement Augmented Reality feature that shows kids where to "put it away", or other helpful/encouraging information, by overlaying it in the real world space. (mobile)
